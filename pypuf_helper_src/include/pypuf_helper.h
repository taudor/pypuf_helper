/* 
 * Evaulates a set of N challenges with the id transformation,
 * i.e. the challenge set is extended so that each subchallenge
 * is the same.
 * Thereafter, the challenges will be evaluated on a k-XOR Arbiter PUF of length n. 
 * The values of the shape of the challenge set and the Arbiter PUFs are"
 * determined from the numpy arrays.
 * The result of the evaluated challenges has shape (N).
 * 
 * Parameters
 * inputs  - Pointer to the challenges to transform (shape: (N, n))
 * weigths - Pointer to the weights of the Arbiter PUF 
 *           (shape: (k, n))
 * n       - Bitlength of the Aribter PUF
 * k       - Number of used Arbiter chains
 * N       - Number of challenges
 * ret_ptr - Address of the pointer that will contain the transformed
 *           challenges containing of -1, 1 (shape: (N)).
